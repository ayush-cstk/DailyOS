DAILY GOALS:
- Calories: ${goals.calories} kcal
- Protein: ${goals.proteinG}g

- Fat: ${goals.fatG}g

MEALS LOGGED TODAY:
${mealList}

CURRENT TOTALS vs GOALS:
- Calories:  ${Math.round(totals.calories)}/${goals.calories} kcal (${calPct}%) — ${Math.round(calRemaining)} kcal remaining
- Protein:   ${Math.round(totals.proteinG)}/${goals.proteinG}g (${protPct}%) — ${Math.round(protRemaining)}g remaining
- Carbs:     ${Math.round(totals.carbsG)}/${goals.carbsG}g (${carbPct}%) — ${Math.round(carbRemaining)}g remaining
- Fat:       ${Math.round(totals.fatG)}/${goals.fatG}g (${fatPct}%) — ${Math.round(fatRemaining)}g remaining

Provide a structured response:
1. **Today's Score** – One sentence on how today is tracking overall.
2. **Biggest Gap** – Which macro is most off target and why it matters.
3. **What to Eat Next** – 2-3 specific Indian food suggestions (with approximate macros) to close the biggest gaps before end of day. Be practical — suggest common foods like dal, paneer, eggs, roti, rice, curd, chicken, soya chunks, etc.
4. **One Thing to Avoid** – What to skip or limit for the rest of today based on what's already over target.
5. **Tomorrow's Focus** – One specific habit or meal change for tomorrow.

Be concise, motivating, and specific. Under 220 words. No generic advice.`;
